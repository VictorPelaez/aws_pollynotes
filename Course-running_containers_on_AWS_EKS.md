# Running Containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

Course objectives
In this course, you will learn to:
      • Describe Kubernetes and Amazon EKS fundamentals and the impact of containers on workflows.
      • Build an Amazon EKS cluster by selecting the correct compute resources to support worker nodes.
      • Secure your environment with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication and Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization.
      • Deploy an application on the cluster. Publish container images to Amazon ECR and secure access via IAM policy.
      • Deploy applications using automated tools and pipelines. Create a GitOps pipeline using WeaveFlux.
      • Collect monitoring data through metrics, logs, and tracing with AWS X-Ray and identify metrics for performance tuning. Review scenarios where bottlenecks require the best scaling approach using horizontal or vertical scaling.
      • Assess the tradeoffs between efficiency, resiliency, and cost and the impact of tuning for one over the others. Describe and outline a holistic, iterative approach to optimizing your environment. Design for cost, efficiency, and resiliency.
      • Configure AWS networking services to support the cluster. Describe how Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) supports Amazon EKS clusters and simplifies inter-node communications. Describe the function of the VPC Container Network Interface (CNI). Review the benefits of a service mesh.
      • Upgrade your Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, and third party tools.

## Lab 1: Building an Amazon EKS Environment
In this lab, you install the command line interface (CLI) tools that are required to deploy and interact with Amazon EKS and Kubernetes. You then deploy an Amazon EKS cluster, node group, and a sample microservices application that runs in containers on the Amazon EKS cluster.
