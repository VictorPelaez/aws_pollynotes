# The Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS



## Labs

**Lab 1 - Introduction to Amazon SageMaker**
In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to launch an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. From that instance, you will learn how to launch a Jupyter notebook. You will then learn how to navigate the Jupyter notebook by exploring a sample business problem that predicts if a customer will invest in a term deposit at a bank after one or more phone calls.
